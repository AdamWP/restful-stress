Load and Stress test against RESTful web service

This is the Electron version of RESTful Stress, a Chrome App available on 
[Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/restful-stress/lljgneahfmgjmpglpbhmkangancgdgeb) (while it lasts).

I'm going to figure out which is the best way to distribute for WIndows, Mac and Linux. For now I just have executable for WIndows and Linux; Mac support is coming soon...

## Instructions:
Just download the compressed "zip" file, unpack, launch the executable...et voil√†!

## Releases:
- v1.6.1 - 2017-05-07
  - [Windows (portable version)](https://github.com/maurobussini/restful-stress/raw/master/dist/1.6.1/restful-stress.1.6.1.win.portable.zip)
  - [Linux (portable version)](https://github.com/maurobussini/restful-stress/raw/master/dist/1.6.1/restful-stress.1.6.1.linux.portable.zip)
